			<li>We have never been a political party which acts stubbornly to different parts of the society. We have 50% of the votes, but defined ourselves as the government party of 100%.</li>
			<li>We are listening to the sound of the street and have a deep research to understand the situation. We will consider the demands for the democratic rights and do empathy as we have done so far.</li>
			<li>Items in the public domain are damaged, public buses and bus stations are destroyed. People are bothered by horns, pots and pans and slogans until late hours of night. That was a pollution.</li>
			</ul>'

			:html => '<ul>
			<li>They are telling that "the Prime Minister is increasing the tension, the Prime Minister is acting harsh." Are we supposed to beg on our knees for moving down the posters of Abdullah Öcalan [leader of PKK]? If you call this as harshness, excuse me, this is Tayyip Erdoğan and it will never ever change.</li>
			<li>I am calling out to the group of people whose ages are around 20-25 and have not experienced the Turkey\'s conditions before AKP. I love you, in the name of God. Dear young people, the opportunities that you have today, were not even imagened 10.5 years ago.</li>
			<li>How could the ones give an account for holding our girls from their scarfes and carrying them on the floor? They even carried the wife of a close friend of mine on the floor, even though she is 6 months pregnant. They harassed to her and her child.</li>
			</ul>'

			<li>Do you know the news that I have from Gezi Park? Park reeks, I guess you assume what I mean. Those are done in the context of environmentalism. You would enter the Bezm-i Alem Valide Sultan Mosque with your shoes, you would drink alcohol there, show disrespectful behaviours against religious shrines, for what? For environment... You would threat the imam of the mosque, force him to speak differently. We have all the videos and we will give all of those to the press at Friday.</li>
			<li>Those events are the test for the press, non-governmental organizations, equity groups. It clarified who stays where for Turkey\'s economy and democracy.</li>
